# THE IDEA

"tower" defense game that trolls you

you can shoot the enemies and also place traps on the track that enemies go around no matter what

# THE WAVES

- 1: basic enemies going down the path using a pre-a*'d route. map has a loop-de-loop that no-one takes
- 2: summore' basic enemies but this time the player will have placed traps. the enemies will go around the traps because they are weighted more than the surrounding terrain
- 3: basic enemies for a bit, but this time also a type of enemy that dodges your projectiles by rerouting around them using a*! you will have unlocked a homing upgrade just for this
- 4: more of the dodging enemies for a little bit, maybe a third type of enemy that's just bigger and bulkier and runs into your projectiles via pursuit/seek
- 5: every enemy will decide they will just run to the end instead of following the path by using seek behavior (dodger enemies will avoid using evade behavior instead)

# GAME OVER CUTSCENE

a ball will arrive at another ball and the moment it stops you go back to the title screen

# TITLE SCREEN

a bajjilion spheres run away from your cursor using flee ig idk

# UPGRADES

- homing (using pursue)
- damage up
- firerate up

# TRAPS

- one spike trap
- explosive trap that exclusively detonates while nothing is around to be killed by it
- nuclear trap that explodes so hard it closes the game
- golden spike trap (really expensive)
